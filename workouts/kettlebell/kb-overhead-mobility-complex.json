  "tips": [
    "One kettlebell — @Asgooch used 24kg",
    "All reps on one side before switching — no rest between exercises",
    "The overhead squat is the hardest part — if mobility is limited, reduce depth",
    "Snatch sets up the overhead position for lunges and squats — smooth transition",
    "60 seconds rest between rounds (after both sides are done)",
    "Great test of shoulder mobility and overhead stability under fatigue"
