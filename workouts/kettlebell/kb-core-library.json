    "This is a reference library — mix and match exercises as core finishers",
    "Russian twists: sit, lean back, rotate KB side to side",
    "Windmills: KB overhead, hinge sideways — great for obliques and mobility",
    "Side bends: KB in one hand, lateral flexion only",
    "Add any of these to the end of your main kettlebell workout",
