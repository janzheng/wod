  "description": "A beautiful 5-move kettlebell flow from a Facebook reel. Dead clean from the floor, squat, lateral lunge, bent press overhead, then tactical clean back to start. Perform the full flow on one side, then repeat on the other. Smooth, controlled, and deceptively challenging.",

  "tips": [
    "This is a FLOW — all 5 exercises connect seamlessly, no pausing between moves",
    "The bent press is the hardest part — if you're new to it, practice separately first",
    "Use a moderate weight — this is about movement quality, not max strength",
    "5 rounds each side = 50 total reps (25 per side)",
    "Rest 60 seconds between rounds (after completing both sides)",
    "Great for shoulder mobility, hip flexibility, and full-body coordination"
