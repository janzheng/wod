    "The quad pre-exhaust superset is BRUTAL - your quads will be screaming before compound",
    "On leg press/squat: go deep, control the negative, explode (but controlled) on positive",
    "You may need to reduce weight significantly on the compound since quads are pre-fatigued",
    "WAIT AT LEAST 5-7 DAYS before training legs again - they need recovery time",
    "If you can walk normally after this workout, you didn't go hard enough"
