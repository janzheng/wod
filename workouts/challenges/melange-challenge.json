  "tips": [
    "This is an extremely challenging and comprehensive workout - expect 90+ minutes",
    "Break high-rep exercises into manageable sets (e.g., 4 sets of 25 for 100-rep exercises)",
    "For malasana hold: Use a yoga block under your heels if needed. You can work on a computer/device while holding this position",
    "For Russian squats: Use a yoga block under the heel of the bent leg for support",
    "For banded exercises: Adjust band tension based on your strength level",
    "Take rest breaks between exercises as needed - this is about completion, not speed",
    "Focus on form over speed, especially as fatigue sets in",
    "The stretches at the end are important for recovery - don't skip them",
    "For headstand work: Use a wall for safety, especially when learning",
    "Crow pose variations require significant upper body strength - scale as needed",
    "Listen to your body and modify exercises if any cause pain or discomfort"
