# Extraction Notes & Learnings

Running document for patterns, issues, and learnings from extracting workout content.

---

## Common Issues

*Will populate as patterns emerge*

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Twitter/X (Grok extraction)
- Text overlays are usually reliable - Grok reads them well
- Captions often have the key workout parameters (rounds, reps, rest)

### Instagram
- *Notes will be added as we extract from Instagram*

### TikTok
- *Notes will be added as we extract from TikTok*

### YouTube
- *Notes will be added as we extract from YouTube*

## Exercise Name Mappings

Common misnames or variations → standardized names:

| Extracted As | Should Be | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| *will populate* | | |

---

## Things to Watch For

- Rest periods: Could be between exercises OR between rounds - check context
- "Each side" vs total reps - clarify when exercises are unilateral
- Duration vs reps - some exercises use time, others use counts

---

## Extraction Quality Patterns

### High confidence indicators
- Text overlays match spoken/written content
- Standard exercise names used
- Clear rep/set/round structure

### Low confidence indicators
- Exercise names are creative/branded (may need standardization)
- No audio, relying only on visuals
- Complex flows without clear structure
