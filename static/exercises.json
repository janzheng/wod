This significantly increases the lever arm and difficulty. Maintain the forward lean, straight arms, and protracted shoulders. The flatter your back, the harder it becomes. Work toward 10-15 second holds before progressing to straddle planche. This builds the specific strength needed for the straighter body positions."

Your lower back should maintain its natural curve - not pressed flat, not excessively arched. Place hands on your hip bones to monitor for any pelvic movement. Engage your deep core by gently drawing your belly button toward your spine. MAINTAINING this core engagement and keeping your pelvis completely still, slowly lower ONE foot toward the floor until your toe lightly taps the ground, then return to the starting position. Repeat with the other leg. The KEY is keeping your lower back and pelvis absolutely stable - there should be NO rocking, NO arching, NO flattening as your legs move. If you feel your back changing position, you're lowering too fast or too far. Move with CONTROL - take 2-3 seconds to lower, tap, and return. Each toe tap = 1 rep. Alternate legs throughout."

Start with your hands in a standard grip position. Switch your hand position by rotating your wrists - alternate between overhand grip, underhand grip, and various angles. You can also perform wrist circles and rotations while maintaining the bar position. Focus on gradually increasing range of motion with each repetition. This exercise lubricates the wrist joints, improves flexibility, and prepares the wrists and forearms for gripping exercises like pull-ups, barbell squats, or bench presses. Perform slowly and stop if you feel any pain. Great for pre-workout wrist preparation."

Place hands on the ground shoulder-width apart. With a slight jump, kick both feet up simultaneously toward the wall in a 'donkey kick' motion. The goal is to land with both feet on the wall in a back-to-wall handstand position. This teaches the hip drive and shoulder positioning needed for freestanding handstand kick-ups. Start with small kicks, gradually increasing height as you build confidence. Focus on keeping arms straight and shoulders open throughout the kick."

Place forearms parallel on the floor, shoulder-width apart, with palms flat or fingers interlaced. Walk your feet toward your elbows to stack hips over shoulders. Kick one leg up (or press both legs up for advanced practitioners) into the inverted position. Balance with legs together, pointed toward the ceiling, body in a straight line. Keep your core engaged, press firmly through your forearms, and look between your hands. Practice against a wall first before attempting freestanding. This builds shoulder strength and body awareness for handstand progression."

From a dead hang, engage your entire posterior chain and pull your body up and back until you're completely horizontal. Arms are straight, body forms one rigid line from hands to toes, legs straight and together. This requires extraordinary lat strength, core tension, and total body control. The pulling force comes primarily from your lats - think about pulling the bar toward your hips. Common mistakes: bent arms, piked hips, sagging body. Master all progressions first: tuck (10-15s), advanced tuck (10-15s), straddle (10-15s). Achieving even a 5-second hold with perfect form is a significant accomplishment."

From this horizontal position, pull yourself up toward the bar while maintaining your body's horizontal orientation. Lower back to the front lever position with control. This is significantly harder than a standard pull-up because of the mechanical disadvantage and the need to maintain core tension throughout. Even performing tuck front lever pulls builds incredible strength. Focus on quality over quantity - a few good reps trump sloppy high reps."

The strength demands on your anterior deltoids, chest, and core are extreme. Most athletes require years of dedicated training to achieve this. Prerequisites: straddle planche (10+ seconds), exceptional pushing strength, conditioned wrists, and patience. Don't rush this progression - proper development prevents shoulder injuries.

Your body should form an angle with the ground - the more you lean forward, the harder it becomes. Keep your core tight, maintain a straight body line, and protract your shoulder blades (push them away from your spine). Hold this position. This builds the straight arm scapular strength (SASS) and core stability needed for planche training. Start with shorter holds (10-30 seconds) and gradually increase as strength improves."

At the top, actively squeeze your shoulder blades together and down, creating an extra 'shrug' of retraction. Lower with control, maintaining scapular engagement until the bottom.

The rings want to move apart, so you must actively squeeze them in while pushing. Keep your core tight and avoid excessive swinging. Master support holds and parallel bar dips before attempting ring dips. These build incredible pushing strength and shoulder stability."

    "description": "An inverted row performed on rings using a false grip - essential training for muscle-ups. Set rings at hip height and hang underneath with feet on the floor. Use a false grip: instead of gripping the rings in your palm, wrap your wrist over the ring so the bottom of your palm sits on top of the ring. This positions your wrist deep in the ring. Pull your chest to the rings while maintaining the false grip, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Lower with control. The false grip is uncomfortable at first but is prerequisite for ring muscle-ups. Start with feet elevated less to make it easier, progress to feet elevated on a box for full difficulty."

    "description": "A muscle-up performed on gymnastics rings - often considered easier than bar muscle-ups due to the rings' freedom of movement. Start in a dead hang with a false grip (wrists wrapped over the rings). Pull powerfully, keeping the rings close to your body. As your chest reaches ring height, lean forward aggressively and transition by rotating your hands, moving from below the rings to above them. Press up to support hold. The false grip is essential - without it, the transition is nearly impossible. The rings can move with you, making the transition smoother than on a fixed bar. Prerequisites: false grip rows, ring dips, and 10+ pull-ups."

Pull yourself up by driving your elbows down, bringing your chest toward the rings. The more you walk your feet forward (body more horizontal), the harder it becomes. Keep your body straight from head to heels, core engaged throughout. This builds the pulling strength and ring stability needed for full ring pull-ups while allowing you to control the difficulty."

Rings should be turned out (palms facing forward, or RTO) for the full gymnastics standard - this is significantly harder than neutral grip. Keep your body upright, core tight, and shoulders depressed. The rings want to move - you must actively squeeze them in and stabilize. This builds the shoulder stability and straight-arm strength fundamental to all ring work. Master this before attempting ring dips. Work toward 30-60 seconds with rings turned out. The ring support is a strength feat in itself."

MAINTAINING this position with your core engaged, reach your right hand toward your right heel by side-bending through your waist - sliding your hand along the floor. You should feel your right oblique contract. Return to center, then reach your left hand toward your left heel. Move SLOWLY and with control - this is not about speed. Keep your lower back pressed into the mat throughout. The movement is a controlled side-bend, not a full twist. Think of shortening one side of your waist while lengthening the other. Each reach (left or right) = 1 rep. Alternate sides smoothly. If your neck gets tired, rest briefly and resume."

Lift your legs up and thread them between your arms, continuing to rotate backwards until your body passes through and you're in a 'German hang' position (hanging with arms behind you). Pause briefly, then reverse the movement to return to the starting hang. Keep arms straight throughout and move slowly with control. This builds the shoulder extension flexibility and strength needed for back levers and muscle-ups. Prerequisites: comfortable dead hang, hanging leg raises, and decent shoulder mobility. Start with bent knees (tuck) before progressing to straight legs."

The heel rises naturally while the front of the foot stays put - this is a passive movement, not an active lift. When the heel reaches the top of its range of motion, passively release it to come back down. The aim is to simultaneously shorten the calf muscle while the soleus is naturally activated by its motor neurons. Keep the gastrocnemius relaxed - you can place your hand on the back of your calf near the knee to ensure it doesn't flex. This targets the soleus muscle specifically, which is important for metabolic health and ankle stability."

At the bottom of your exhale, draw your belly button IN and UP toward your spine as hard as you can, as if trying to touch your belly button to your backbone. You should feel your waist narrowing and your abdomen becoming hollow/concave. HOLD this position for the prescribed time (30 seconds) while taking small, shallow breaths through your chest only - do NOT let your belly expand. It will burn. Release and breathe normally between sets. For QUADRUPED version: Start on hands and knees, let your belly hang, exhale completely, then suck everything in and hold. This is harder because gravity is working against you. Key: This is NOT sucking in your gut superficially - it's a deep internal drawing-in sensation."

Legs are straight and spread wide in a straddle. The wider the straddle, the easier due to the shorter lever arm. Body should form a straight line from head through hips. Shoulders are protracted, arms locked straight. This requires exceptional pushing strength - particularly in the anterior deltoids - plus total body tension. The balance point is precise; too far forward and you fall, not far enough and you can't hold the position. Master advanced tuck planche (10-15 seconds) before attempting. Even a 3-5 second hold is impressive."

Lie on your back with knees bent at 90 degrees, feet lifted so your shins are parallel to the ceiling (tabletop position). Keep your arms by your sides for stability. First, engage your deep core - exhale and gently draw your belly button toward your spine. MAINTAINING core engagement, slowly let one knee drop out to the side (abduction) while keeping the other knee pointing straight up. Only go as far as you can while keeping your pelvis level and lower back neutral - you should feel NO rotation in your spine. Return the leg to center and repeat on the other side. Move SLOWLY and with control. The challenge is keeping your pelvis rock-solid while your legs move. If you feel your back arching or your pelvis tilting, reduce your range of motion. Each leg drop = 1 rep. Alternate sides."

First, find your neutral spine position - there should be a small natural curve in your lower back (you could slide your hand under). Gently engage your deep core by exhaling and drawing your belly button slightly toward your spine WITHOUT flattening your back. MAINTAINING this core engagement, slowly slide one heel along the floor to extend that leg fully, then slide it back to the start position. The KEY is keeping your pelvis completely still and your lower back in neutral - no rocking, no arching, no flattening. If your back arches as the leg extends, you've gone too far. Alternate legs. Move SLOWLY - this is about control, not speed. Each leg extension = 1 rep. Breathe naturally throughout, exhaling as you extend."

Touch your toes (or shins) to the bar between your hands. Lower with control and repeat. The strict version eliminates the kip - raise legs using only core and hip flexor strength.

While holding at the top, shift your body horizontally from one hand to the other - as you move toward one hand, that arm bends more while the other straightens. Move back and forth like a typewriter carriage. This is extremely demanding, requiring you to support most of your weight on one arm at each end. It's an excellent progression toward one-arm pull-ups. Lower and repeat, or continue typing for multiple passes."

Sit on the floor with your knees bent, feet flat, hands placed slightly behind your hips for support (fingers pointing forward or out to sides). Lean back slightly to about 45 degrees - you should feel your abs engage to hold this position. Lift your feet off the floor with knees still bent, shins roughly parallel to the ground - this is your starting position. Now perform the tuck: EXHALE and bring your knees toward your chest while simultaneously leaning your torso slightly forward to meet them, creating a 'V' shape with your body. INHALE and extend back to the starting position with legs out (knees can stay slightly bent) and torso leaning back. Move with CONTROL - do not use momentum or swing. The key is maintaining constant core tension throughout the movement. Keep your spine in a neutral position (not rounded) and your chest lifted. Each tuck-and-extend = 1 rep. To make it easier, keep feet lightly touching the floor between reps. To make it harder, keep legs fully extended."

Lower with control back to shoulder height. The band provides accommodating resistance - harder at the top of the movement when the band is most stretched. Great for building overhead pressing strength, shoulder stability, and as a warm-up before heavier pressing work."
