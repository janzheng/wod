      "description": "Place kettlebell on floor between wide-set feet. Hinge forward keeping torso nearly parallel to the ground throughout. Squat down straddling the kettlebell, grab it, and stand partially while maintaining the forward lean. Torso stays hunched over the entire time.",
      "notes": "This is the unusual form shown in the video - torso stays bent forward throughout. Loads posterior chain more like a squat/good-morning hybrid. Non-standard form."

      "notes": "Standard goblet squat with upright torso. This is the conventional form - contrasts with the bent-over version also shown."

    "transcript": "Bro, you should be doing only legs for a little bit. People that have larger leg muscles, those are the muscles That keep you aging slower They actually have longer life expectancy That's why runners notoriously do well Runners that eat as well and combine some strength training in there And build muscle mass They have long life expectancy",

    "visualSummary": "A muscular man in a gym (near a smith machine) performs deep squat movements with a kettlebell. His torso is completely hunched over/bent forward throughout both exercises - very unusual form. First exercise is a bent-over straddle squat, second appears similar with slightly different stance."
