Shows a 35-minute full-body session covering goblet squats, swings, overhead presses, rows, lunges, and deadlifts. More of a motivational montage than a prescriptive routine.",

    "transcript": "The beautiful thing about kettlebell training is you don't need an entire gym. All you need is one or two kettlebells and you can train anything. Cardio, strength, mobility, muscle building are all of them. And you only need 30 to 45 minutes to get in probably a better workout than you would at the gym. This workout took me 35 minutes. Hit full body.",
    "caption": "An entire gym, all rolled into one piece of training equipment. One kettlebell can get you in amazing shape. They're great for strength, conditioning, mobility, and athleticism. So ditch the gym membership and train with kettlebells!",
