  "description": "Stand on the pendulum squat platform with shoulders under the pads and feet positioned forward on the plate. Descend by bending at the knees, allowing the pendulum arm to swing back as you lower into a deep squat. Drive through your feet to return to the top, squeezing the quads at lockout. The pendulum arc heavily loads the quads while reducing spinal compression."
