  "description": "Sit on the floor with legs spread as wide as comfortable in a straddle position. Keep your legs straight and toes pointing up. Fold forward from the hips, reaching your hands out in front of you or toward one leg at a time. Hold each position for 30-60 seconds. This stretches the inner thighs (adductors) and hamstrings. Essential for developing the flexibility needed for straddle holds and pancake stretches."
