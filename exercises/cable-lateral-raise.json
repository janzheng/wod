  "description": "Stand sideways to a low cable pulley with the handle in your far hand (cable crosses in front of your body). Keep a slight bend in your elbow and raise your arm out to the side until it reaches shoulder height. Lower with control. The cable provides constant tension throughout the range of motion, unlike dumbbells which are hardest at the top. Complete all reps then switch sides."
