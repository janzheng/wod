  "description": "Sit upright in the pin loaded chest press machine with back flat against the pad and handles at mid-chest height. Press the handles forward, extending your arms without locking elbows. Squeeze the chest at full extension and return with control. The vertical seated position and pin loaded weight stack make this machine easy to adjust between sets and ideal for drop sets."
