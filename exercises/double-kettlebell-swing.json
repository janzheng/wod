  "description": "Same as a standard kettlebell swing but with two bells. Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, a kettlebell in each hand on the floor between your feet. Hike both bells back, then explosively snap hips forward to swing them to chest height. The doubled load demands significantly more grip strength, core stability, and hip power. Keep arms straight and let the hips do the work.",
