  "description": "Lie on your back with shoulders slightly lifted and hands by your sides or under your hips. Rapidly snap one leg up toward the ceiling then back down while the other stays low, alternating with quick, sharp movements. Focus on speed and precision - each kick should be a quick snap, not a slow lift. Keep core engaged throughout to protect lower back."
