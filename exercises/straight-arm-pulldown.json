  "description": "Stand facing a cable machine with a straight bar or rope attachment at the high pulley. Grab the attachment with straight arms, hands shoulder-width apart. Hinge slightly at the hips and keep a small bend in your elbows. Pull the bar down toward your thighs in an arc, keeping arms straight throughout. Squeeze your lats hard at the bottom. Control the weight back up, feeling the stretch in your lats. This is a pure lat isolation movement - keep your arms straight to take biceps out of the equation."
