  "description": "A clean variation that emphasizes control and precision. From the floor or hang position, clean the kettlebell to rack using a threading or rotational motion. Often used as a transition movement in kettlebell flows and complexes. The 'tactical' element comes from the controlled, deliberate nature of the movement — no unnecessary momentum."
