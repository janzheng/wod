  "description": "The standard single-leg kick-up entry into a handstand. Start in a lunge position with hands on the floor shoulder-width apart, front leg bent, back leg straight. Shift weight onto your hands while kicking your back leg up powerfully toward the ceiling. As the back leg rises, push off with your front foot to bring both legs together overhead. For wall-assisted practice, kick up to a back-to-wall handstand first. The key is leading with your hips - think of stacking your hips over your shoulders first, then bringing the legs together. Keep arms straight and actively push through your shoulders. Practice controlled kick-ups before attempting freestanding holds."
