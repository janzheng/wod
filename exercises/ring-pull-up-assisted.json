  "description": "A ring pull-up with feet on the ground for assistance - perfect for building toward full ring pull-ups. Set rings at a height where you can hold them while standing with arms extended overhead. Keep your feet on the ground, walking them forward so your body is at an angle. Pull yourself up by driving your elbows down, bringing your chest toward the rings. The more you walk your feet forward (body more horizontal), the harder it becomes. Keep your body straight from head to heels, core engaged throughout. This builds the pulling strength and ring stability needed for full ring pull-ups while allowing you to control the difficulty."
