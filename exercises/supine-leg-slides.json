  "description": "A foundational dead bug progression that teaches core stability during leg movement. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on floor. First, find your neutral spine position - there should be a small natural curve in your lower back (you could slide your hand under). Gently engage your deep core by exhaling and drawing your belly button slightly toward your spine WITHOUT flattening your back. MAINTAINING this core engagement, slowly slide one heel along the floor to extend that leg fully, then slide it back to the start position. The KEY is keeping your pelvis completely still and your lower back in neutral - no rocking, no arching, no flattening. If your back arches as the leg extends, you've gone too far. Alternate legs. Move SLOWLY - this is about control, not speed. Each leg extension = 1 rep. Breathe naturally throughout, exhaling as you extend."
