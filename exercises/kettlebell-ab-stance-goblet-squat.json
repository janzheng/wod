  "description": "A goblet squat variation alternating between two foot positions. Hold the kettlebell at chest height. 'A stance' is a wider sumo-style position targeting adductors and glutes. 'B stance' is a narrow, shoulder-width position emphasizing quads. Alternate between stances each rep or every few reps. The stance switching challenges balance and hits the legs from multiple angles in a single set.",
