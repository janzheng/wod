  "description": "The first progression toward a full front lever. Hang from a bar or rings with straight arms. Pull your knees to your chest in a tight tuck position. Using your lats and core, rotate your body backwards until your back is parallel to the ground - like an upside-down plank but with bent knees. Your arms should be straight and perpendicular to your torso. Hold this position. Focus on depressing your shoulders (pulling them away from ears) and squeezing your lats hard. Keep your hips in line with your shoulders - don't let them sag. Start with 5-10 second holds and build up. This builds the pulling strength foundation for advanced front lever progressions."
