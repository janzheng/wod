  "description": "An advanced hanging core exercise where your toes touch the pull-up bar. Hang from a bar with arms extended and shoulders active. Initiate a slight kip by pushing the bar away and creating a small swing. As you swing back, engage your lats and core to pull your hips up while raising straight legs. Touch your toes (or shins) to the bar between your hands. Lower with control and repeat. The strict version eliminates the kip - raise legs using only core and hip flexor strength. This requires significant core compression strength, hip flexor power, and grip endurance. Master hanging leg raises and L-hangs before attempting. Common in CrossFit and gymnastics training."
