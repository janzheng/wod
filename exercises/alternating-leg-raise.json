  "description": "Lie on your back with one foot flat on the floor (knee bent) and the other leg extended. Keep your hands by your sides or under your lower back. Raise the extended leg up toward the ceiling, then lower it back down with control, keeping it straight. Complete all reps on one side before switching. This variation is easier than double leg raises and great for building core strength."
