  "description": "Lie on your back with legs lifted at 45 degrees, shoulders slightly raised. Rapidly criss-cross your legs over and under each other in quick scissoring movements. Move at maximum speed while keeping legs straight and core engaged. The quicker the better - this is about speed and coordination, not range of motion."
