  "description": "Adjust seat height so handles are at mid-chest level. Sit with back flat against pad and feet on floor. Grip handles and press forward, extending arms without locking elbows. Squeeze chest at full extension, then control the weight back. The machine guides your movement path, making this ideal for learning pressing patterns."
