  "description": "Lie on the floor with knees bent. Hold a kettlebell in one hand at shoulder level, elbow on the ground. Press the bell straight up to full extension, then lower until the upper arm touches the floor again. The floor limits range of motion and eliminates leg drive, isolating the pressing muscles. Great for building lockout strength."
