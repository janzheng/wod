  "description": "Clean the kettlebell from a dead stop on the floor to the rack position. Unlike a swing clean, each rep starts from a complete standstill — no momentum. Hinge at the hips, grip the bell, and explosively drive through the hips to pull it into the rack. The dead stop makes each rep harder and builds raw pulling power."
