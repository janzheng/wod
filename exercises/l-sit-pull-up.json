  "description": "A pull-up performed while holding an L-sit position. Hang from a bar and raise your straight legs until they're parallel to the ground (L-position). Hold this leg position throughout the movement. Perform a pull-up while maintaining the L-sit - chin over bar, then lower with control. The L-sit adds significant core and hip flexor demand while also changing the pulling angle. This exercise builds serious functional strength. Prerequisites: solid pull-ups and L-hang holds. If full L-sit is too difficult, start with a tuck (knees bent) and progress to straight legs."
