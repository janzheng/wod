  "description": "The first true planche progression with feet off the ground. Start in a planche lean position with hands on floor or parallettes. Lean forward aggressively, shifting your weight over your hands until your shoulders are well past your fingertips. Keep arms straight. Tuck your knees tight to your chest and lift your feet off the ground. Hold this position with your back rounded and hips at or slightly above shoulder height. The key is the forward lean - without it, you cannot balance. Keep protracted shoulders (push them forward) and maintain whole-body tension. Start with short holds (3-5 seconds) and build up. Prerequisites: 60-second planche lean, solid push-up strength, and good wrist conditioning."
