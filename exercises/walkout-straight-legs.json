  "description": "Stand with feet hip-width apart. Bend at the hips and place your hands on the floor in front of your feet, keeping your legs as straight as possible. Walk your hands forward while maintaining straight legs, shifting your weight onto your hands. Continue walking forward until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to heels (plank position). Keep your core braced, glutes squeezed, and back flat throughout. Hold briefly at the plank position, then walk your hands back toward your feet, still keeping legs straight. Return to standing. This exercise dynamically stretches the hamstrings while warming up the core and shoulders. Focus on maintaining straight legs throughout - if your hamstrings feel tight, continue breathing and work within your range of motion."
