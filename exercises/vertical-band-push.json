  "description": "An overhead press using a resistance band for shoulder strengthening. Stand on the center of a resistance band with feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the band handles or ends at shoulder height with palms facing forward. Press straight up overhead until arms are fully extended, keeping your core tight and avoiding arching your back. Lower with control back to shoulder height. The band provides accommodating resistance - harder at the top of the movement when the band is most stretched. Great for building overhead pressing strength, shoulder stability, and as a warm-up before heavier pressing work."
