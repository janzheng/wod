  "description": "A dynamic movement flowing from standing to push-up and back. Start standing tall with feet hip-width apart. Hinge at the hips and place your hands on the floor in front of your feet. Walk your hands forward until you reach a push-up position. Perform one push-up (optional - can skip for warmup). Walk your hands back toward your feet, keeping legs as straight as possible. Stand back up to the starting position. This combines the inchworm with push-up work, building upper body strength while dynamically stretching the hamstrings. Great as a warm-up or as part of a bodyweight circuit."
