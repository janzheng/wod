  "description": "A pull-up that emphasizes scapular engagement and retraction at the top of the movement. Hang from a pull-up bar with hands shoulder-width apart, palms facing away. Start by performing a scapular pull - depress and retract your shoulder blades while keeping arms straight. Then pull yourself up until your chin clears the bar. At the top, actively squeeze your shoulder blades together and down, creating an extra 'shrug' of retraction. Lower with control, maintaining scapular engagement until the bottom. This reinforces proper back activation during pulling movements and builds the scapular strength needed for advanced calisthenics like front levers and muscle-ups."
