  "description": "Stand with feet wide apart (about double shoulder width). Shift your weight to one side, bending that knee deeply while keeping the other leg completely straight with toes pointing up. Descend as low as possible on the bent leg - ideally hamstring touches calf. Keep your heel down and chest up. The straight leg stretches the adductors. Rise and repeat on the other side. Use a yoga block under your heel if ankle mobility is limited. Also known as Russian squat."
