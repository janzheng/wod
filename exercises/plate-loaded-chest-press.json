  "description": "Lie back on the flat plate loaded press machine with feet on the floor. Grip the handles at chest level and press forward, extending your arms without locking the elbows. Squeeze the chest at full extension and return with control. Plate loaded machines allow independent arm movement and a more natural pressing arc compared to pin-loaded alternatives."
