  "description": "Lie on your back with hands behind head and both legs extended straight. Perform a bicycle motion but keep your legs straight as you bring each leg up. Twist your torso to bring opposite elbow toward the raised leg. This is more challenging than bent-leg bicycles due to the longer lever arm."
