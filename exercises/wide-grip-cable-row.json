  "description": "Sit at the cable row machine with a wide grip attachment. Place your feet on the platform and extend your arms fully. Grip the wide bar with hands wider than shoulder-width. Pull the bar toward your upper chest, leading with your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together. This wider grip emphasizes the upper back and rear deltoids. Control the weight back to the starting position."
