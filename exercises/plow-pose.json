Keep your legs straight and support your lower back with your hands, or extend arms along the floor for a deeper stretch. Your weight should be on your shoulders, not your neck. This pose stretches the entire posterior chain and calms the nervous system. Hold for 30-60 seconds. Contraindicated for those with neck injuries."
