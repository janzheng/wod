  "description": "A fundamental gymnastics hold where you support your body on your hands with legs extended horizontally. Sit on the floor (or use parallettes/push-up bars for easier clearance) with legs straight in front of you. Place hands beside your hips, fingers pointing forward. Press down through your palms, straighten your arms, and lift your entire body off the ground. Keep legs straight and together, parallel to the floor, forming an L-shape with your torso. Hold this position with core engaged and shoulders depressed. This requires significant core compression strength, hip flexor endurance, tricep strength, and shoulder stability. Progress from tuck L-sits (knees bent) to one-leg extended to full L-sit."
