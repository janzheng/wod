  "description": "Place your feet on top of a kettlebell (on its side or upright) and perform pushups from this elevated position. The elevation shifts more load to the upper chest and shoulders compared to flat pushups. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. The slight instability from the kettlebell also engages your core. Modify on knees if needed."
