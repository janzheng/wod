  "description": "A complete pulling-to-pushing movement: pull yourself up and over the bar (or rings) to end in a dip support position. From a dead hang, perform an explosive pull-up while driving your chest toward the bar. As your chest reaches bar height, lean forward aggressively and transition your hands from pulling to pushing, rolling over the bar. Press up to full arm extension in the support position. The key is the transition - the pull must be high enough and the forward lean aggressive enough to get over the bar. Bar muscle-ups typically use a kip; ring muscle-ups rely more on a false grip and strength. Prerequisites: 10+ pull-ups, dips, and ideally false grip work on rings."
