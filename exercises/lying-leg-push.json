  "description": "Lie on your back with both knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Extend one leg straight up toward the ceiling. Press through the heel of your grounded foot to lift your hips off the floor, creating a straight line from your shoulders to your knee. Keep the extended leg reaching upward throughout. Squeeze your glutes at the top, then lower with control. This single-leg bridge variation isolates each glute independently."
