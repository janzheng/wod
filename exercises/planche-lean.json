  "description": "A foundational planche progression exercise. Start in a push-up position with hands on the floor, fingers pointing forward. Lean your shoulders forward past your fingertips while keeping your feet on the ground and arms straight. Your body should form an angle with the ground - the more you lean forward, the harder it becomes. Keep your core tight, maintain a straight body line, and protract your shoulder blades (push them away from your spine). Hold this position. This builds the straight arm scapular strength (SASS) and core stability needed for planche training. Start with shorter holds (10-30 seconds) and gradually increase as strength improves."
