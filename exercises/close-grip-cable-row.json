  "description": "Sit at the cable row machine with a close grip handle attachment. Secure your feet on the platform and extend your arms fully. Grip the handle with hands close together, palms facing each other. Pull the handle toward your lower chest/upper abdomen, keeping your elbows close to your body. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement. This close grip emphasizes the middle traps and rhomboids."
