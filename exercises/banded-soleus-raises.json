  "description": "Sit on a chair or bench with knees bent at 90 degrees. Place a resistance band over your knees and stand on the band with the balls of your feet. Raise your heels off the ground by pushing through your toes, lifting against the band resistance. Lower with control. The bent knee position targets the soleus muscle specifically, which is crucial for ankle stability and endurance activities like running."
