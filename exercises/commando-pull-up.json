  "description": "A pull-up variation performed with hands in line (one in front of the other) along the bar. Stand perpendicular to the bar and grip it with one hand in front of the other, palms facing each other. Pull up, bringing your head to one side of the bar. Lower and repeat, alternating which side of the bar your head goes to. This grip variation hits your muscles differently, adding rotational core work and grip challenge. Also called a typewriter pull-up or commando grip pull-up."
