  "description": "Lie face down on the floor with arms at your sides, palms facing up, or hands behind your head. Keep your legs straight and together. Slowly raise your upper body (chest and shoulders) off the floor by extending your lower back, lifting as high as comfortable without hyperextending. Squeeze your glutes and lower back muscles at the top. Lower back down with control. Focus on using your erector spinae (lower back muscles) to lift, not momentum. Keep your neck in a neutral position - don't crane it upward. This strengthens the posterior chain and improves spinal stability. Can be done with arms extended overhead for added difficulty."
