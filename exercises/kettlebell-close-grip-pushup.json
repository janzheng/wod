  "description": "Place a kettlebell on its side or use two kettlebells. Grip the handles with both hands in a close/narrow grip. Perform pushups from this position, keeping elbows tucked close to the body. The narrow grip shifts emphasis to the triceps and inner chest. The elevated hand position also increases range of motion compared to floor pushups.",
