  "description": "A fundamental gymnastics movement that builds shoulder mobility and strength through a full rotation. Hang from rings or a bar. Lift your legs up and thread them between your arms, continuing to rotate backwards until your body passes through and you're in a 'German hang' position (hanging with arms behind you). Pause briefly, then reverse the movement to return to the starting hang. Keep arms straight throughout and move slowly with control. This builds the shoulder extension flexibility and strength needed for back levers and muscle-ups. Prerequisites: comfortable dead hang, hanging leg raises, and decent shoulder mobility. Start with bent knees (tuck) before progressing to straight legs."
