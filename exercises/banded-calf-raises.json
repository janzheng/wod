  "description": "Stand on a resistance band with the balls of your feet, holding the band handles at shoulder height or stepping on the band to create tension. Rise up onto your toes as high as possible, squeezing your calves at the top. Lower with control. The band adds progressive resistance throughout the movement. Best performed for high reps (50-100) to fully fatigue the calves."
