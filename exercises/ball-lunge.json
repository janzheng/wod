  "description": "Stand facing away from a stability ball. Place the top of one foot on the ball behind you, toes pointed down. The ball should be about a leg's length away. Keep your front foot firmly planted. Lower into a lunge by bending your front knee, allowing the ball to roll slightly as your back leg extends. Descend until your front thigh is parallel to the ground. Push through your front heel to stand. The ball challenges your balance and activates stabilizer muscles."
