  "description": "The most demanding double kettlebell movement. From the floor or swing position, explosively pull both bells overhead in one continuous motion, punching through at the top to lockout with arms straight. Requires tremendous grip, shoulder stability, and explosive hip power. Master single-bell snatches and double cleans before attempting. Keep core and glutes tight throughout.",
