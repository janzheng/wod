  "description": "Start on all fours with knees wider than hip-width. Turn your feet out so the inner edges are on the ground. Slowly widen your knees and sink your hips back, lowering onto your forearms if comfortable. You should feel a deep stretch in your inner thighs and hips. This is an intense hip opener."
