  "description": "A challenging core exercise performed hanging from a pull-up bar. Hang from a bar with arms fully extended and shoulders engaged (not passive hanging). Keep your legs straight and together. Using your core and hip flexors, raise your legs until they are parallel to the ground (L-position) or higher. Lower with control without swinging. Avoid using momentum - the movement should be slow and controlled. If full leg raises are too difficult, start with knee raises (bending knees to chest) and progress to straight leg raises. This exercise builds serious core strength and hip flexor power, essential for L-sits, front levers, and toes-to-bar."
