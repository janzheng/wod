  "description": "A dynamic front lever progression that moves between inverted hang and front lever. Start by pulling up into an inverted hang (body vertical, upside down). With straight arms, lower your body toward horizontal (front lever position), pause, then pull back up to inverted. The 'ice cream maker' name comes from the churning motion. This builds the specific lat and core strength for front levers through a full range of motion. Use your progression level: tuck, advanced tuck, or straddle. Focus on controlled movement - no swinging. This exercise develops strength through the entire range that a static hold cannot."
