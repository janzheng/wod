  "description": "Sit or stand holding dumbbells at shoulder height with palms facing your body (like the top of a bicep curl). As you press the weights overhead, rotate your palms to face forward by the time your arms are fully extended. Reverse the movement on the way down - rotate palms back toward you as you lower the weights to the starting position. This rotation works all three heads of the deltoid through a full range of motion. Named after Arnold Schwarzenegger who popularized this variation."
