  "description": "Walk up to a wall-supported handstand to build strength and body awareness. Start in a push-up position with your feet against a wall. Walk your feet up the wall while simultaneously walking your hands backward toward the wall. Continue until your chest faces the wall and you are in a full handstand position with hands about 6-12 inches from the wall. Hold briefly at the top, then reverse the movement - walk hands away from the wall while walking feet down. Keep your core tight and arms straight throughout. This is chest-to-wall handstand practice, which promotes better alignment than back-to-wall. Control is key - don't rush the movement."
