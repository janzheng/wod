  "description": "A handstand entry position using a box to build shoulder strength and body position awareness. Place hands on the floor shoulder-width apart, about 1-2 feet from a sturdy box or elevated surface. Place your feet on the box with knees bent. Walk your hands back toward the box while straightening your legs, until your hips stack over your shoulders and your body forms an L-shape (or closer to inverted as you progress). Hold this position with arms straight, actively pushing through your shoulders, and core engaged. This teaches proper handstand alignment - shoulders over wrists, hollow body position - without the full balance challenge. Progress by walking hands closer to the box for a more vertical position."
