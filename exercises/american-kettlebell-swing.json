  "description": "The overhead kettlebell swing that takes the bell all the way above your head. Start with feet shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the floor in front of you. Hike the kettlebell back between your legs, hinging at the hips with a flat back. Explosively drive your hips forward, using the momentum to swing the kettlebell overhead until your arms are fully extended and the bell is directly above your shoulders. Control the descent, letting gravity and hip hinge absorb the swing. Unlike Russian swings (chest height), the American swing requires full shoulder mobility and core control at the top. Master Russian swings first before progressing to this variation."
