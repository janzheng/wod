  "description": "Perform V-ups at an accelerated pace. Lie flat, then explosively bring legs and torso up to meet in a V-shape, touching hands to feet. Quickly lower and immediately repeat. Focus on rapid transitions rather than holding at the top. This explosive version builds power and cardiovascular endurance alongside core strength."
