  "description": "Lie on your back with legs extended. Lift your legs toward the ceiling, then use your core to lift your hips off the floor, pressing your legs straight up into a brief shoulder stand position. Lower your hips back down with control, then lower your legs. Each rep involves lifting up to the shoulder stand and returning. A dynamic core exercise that builds strength for full shoulder stands."
