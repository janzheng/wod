  "description": "Lie face down with arms extended overhead or at your sides. Keep your legs straight and lift them as high as possible off the ground, squeezing your glutes and lower back. Hold briefly at the top, then lower with control. This strengthens the posterior chain in the exact position needed for back lever progressions. Focus on lifting from the glutes and back, not momentum."
