  "description": "Position bar across upper back (not on neck). Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, soft bend in knees. Unhook the bar and brace your core. Push hips back while keeping back flat, lowering torso until nearly parallel to floor. Feel the stretch in hamstrings. Drive hips forward to return. The guided bar path helps maintain form while loading the posterior chain. Start light to master the movement."
