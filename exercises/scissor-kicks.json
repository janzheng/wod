  "description": "Lie on your back with legs extended and shoulders slightly lifted. Raise both legs off the floor. Cross one leg over the other in a controlled scissoring motion, then switch - alternating which leg is on top. Keep legs straight and core engaged throughout. Unlike flutter kicks (up/down), scissor kicks move legs side-to-side, crossing over and under each other."
