  "description": "Set a low cable behind a bench. Sit facing away from the cable and grasp the handle behind you with arm extended. Curl the weight forward and up by flexing at the elbow, squeezing the bicep at the top. Lower with control back to a full stretch. This position places the long head of the biceps under greater stretch, emphasizing its development."
