  "description": "An advanced back lever progression with straight legs spread wide. From German hang or inverted hang, lower your body with straight legs spread apart until your back is parallel to the ground. Arms are straight and behind you. The wider the straddle, the shorter the lever and the easier it is. Keep your entire body in one plane - don't let your hips pike or sag. This position demands significant shoulder flexibility, straight-arm strength, and core tension. The shoulders are in a vulnerable extended position, so ensure you've built up through tuck and advanced tuck progressions first. Hold for time, working toward 10-15 seconds before attempting full back lever."
