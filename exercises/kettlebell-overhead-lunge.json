  "description": "Hold a kettlebell locked out overhead in one hand. Step forward into a lunge, lowering until both knees are at 90 degrees. Keep the arm fully extended and torso upright throughout. Drive through the front heel to return to standing. The overhead position demands serious shoulder stability and core engagement while the legs do the heavy work."
