  "description": "An advanced front lever progression with legs spread wide. From a dead hang, engage your lats powerfully and raise your body until your back is parallel to the ground with arms straight. Legs are straight and spread wide apart (straddled). The wider the straddle, the easier it is - narrow your stance as you get stronger. Keep your body in one straight plane from hands through hips. Shoulders stay depressed, lats fully engaged. Don't let hips pike up or sag down. This requires significant lat strength, core tension, and body control. Hold for time - even 5 seconds is impressive. Master this before attempting full front lever with legs together."
