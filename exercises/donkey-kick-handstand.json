  "description": "A two-footed kick up to handstand that builds explosive power for handstand entries. Start standing facing away from a wall (about 2-3 feet away). Place hands on the ground shoulder-width apart. With a slight jump, kick both feet up simultaneously toward the wall in a 'donkey kick' motion. The goal is to land with both feet on the wall in a back-to-wall handstand position. This teaches the hip drive and shoulder positioning needed for freestanding handstand kick-ups. Start with small kicks, gradually increasing height as you build confidence. Focus on keeping arms straight and shoulders open throughout the kick."
