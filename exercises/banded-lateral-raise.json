  "description": "Stand on the center of a resistance band with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the ends with arms at your sides. Raise your arms out to the sides until they reach shoulder height, keeping a slight bend in your elbows. Lower with control. The band provides progressive resistance, making the top of the movement most challenging. Great for high-rep shoulder conditioning."
