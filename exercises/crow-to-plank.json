  "description": "Start in crow pose with knees on triceps. With control, extend your legs back to plank position while keeping your hands planted. Then jump or step your knees back to your triceps to return to crow pose. This transitions between two fundamental positions and builds the control needed for more advanced skill work. Focus on smooth, controlled movement rather than speed."
