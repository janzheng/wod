  "description": "The top position of a ring dip, held as an isometric. Support yourself on rings with arms straight and locked. Rings should be turned out (palms facing forward, or RTO) for the full gymnastics standard - this is significantly harder than neutral grip. Keep your body upright, core tight, and shoulders depressed. The rings want to move - you must actively squeeze them in and stabilize. This builds the shoulder stability and straight-arm strength fundamental to all ring work. Master this before attempting ring dips. Work toward 30-60 seconds with rings turned out. The ring support is a strength feat in itself."
