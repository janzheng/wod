  "description": "A dead hang with legs raised to form an L-shape. Hang from a bar with arms extended. Engage your core and hip flexors to raise your straight legs until they're parallel to the ground, forming a 90-degree angle with your torso. Hold this position. Keep legs straight and together, toes pointed. Shoulders should be active (not completely relaxed). This builds core compression strength, hip flexor endurance, and grip - all essential for advanced movements like L-sit pull-ups, toes-to-bar, and front levers. Start with tuck hangs (knees bent) if full L-hang is too difficult. Work toward 15-30 second holds."
