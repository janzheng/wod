  "description": "A pull-up variation with hands placed wider than shoulder width to emphasize the lats. Hang from a pull-up bar with hands 1.5x shoulder-width apart, palms facing away (overhand grip). Engage your shoulder blades by pulling them down and back. Pull yourself up by driving your elbows down toward your hips until your chin clears the bar. Focus on squeezing your lats at the top. Lower with control to full arm extension. The wider grip increases lat activation and reduces bicep involvement compared to standard pull-ups. This is sometimes called a shoulder pull-up because of the wider hand position."
