  "description": "Stand facing a box or bench that's about knee height. Place one foot fully on the platform. Drive through the heel of the elevated foot to step up onto the platform, bringing the other foot up to meet it. Step back down with the same leg leading, or alternate legs. Hold dumbbells at sides, a kettlebell at chest, a barbell across back, or use a Smith machine for added resistance. Keep your chest up and core engaged throughout."
