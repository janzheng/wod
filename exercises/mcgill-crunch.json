  "description": "Lie on your back with one hand placed behind your lower back to maintain the natural curve of your spine. Keep one leg straight on the floor and the other leg bent with foot flat. Place your other hand behind your head for support. Slowly raise your head, neck, and shoulders just a few inches off the floor (not a full sit-up) while keeping your lower back pressed against your hand. Hold this position briefly, then lower slowly. The key is minimal movement with maximum muscle activation. Great for posture checking and core warmup. This is part of Dr. Stuart McGill's Big 3 core stability exercises.",
