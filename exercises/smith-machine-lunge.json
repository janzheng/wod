  "description": "Position bar across upper back. Step one foot forward under the bar, the other behind. Unhook and lower until both knees are at 90 degrees. Drive through front heel to stand. Complete all reps on one leg, then switch. The guided bar path provides stability, letting you focus on depth and balance. Great for building single-leg strength."
