  "description": "Loop a resistance band across your upper back and hold the ends in each hand on the floor. Perform push-ups as normal - the band adds resistance at the top of the movement, making lockout harder. This builds explosive pushing power and helps progress toward more difficult push-up variations. Keep core tight throughout."
