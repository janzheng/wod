  "description": "Set two cable pulleys to chest height. Grab a handle in each hand, step forward into a staggered stance, and press both handles forward until your arms are fully extended. Squeeze your chest at the peak, then return with control. The cables provide constant tension and allow a greater range of motion than barbell pressing."
