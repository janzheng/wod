  "description": "Stand in front of a stability ball with one foot placed on top of the ball behind you (Bulgarian split squat position with ball). Keep your front foot firmly planted and core engaged. Lower your body by bending your front knee until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Push through your front heel to return to standing. The unstable surface of the ball increases core and stabilizer engagement."
