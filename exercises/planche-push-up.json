  "description": "An advanced calisthenics movement where your body is held horizontally parallel to the ground, supported only by your hands, while performing a pushing motion. Start in a planche position (body horizontal, feet off ground) - this can be tuck planche, advanced tuck, straddle, or full planche depending on your level. With straight arms, lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping your body horizontal throughout. Press back up to full arm extension. Requires exceptional upper-body strength, core stability, and total-body control. Prerequisites include planche lean holds (30-60 seconds), tuck planche holds, strong core, and wrist conditioning. Keep your core rigid and maintain a straight body line from head to heels throughout the movement."
