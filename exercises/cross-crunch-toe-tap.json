  "description": "An alternating cross-body crunch with a toe tap. Lie on your back with legs extended and arms reaching overhead. Lift your right leg and reach your left hand across your body to tap the outside of your right foot, crunching your obliques. Lower back down with control, then repeat on the opposite side - left leg up, right hand reaches to tap. Keep your lower back pressed into the floor and exhale as you crunch up. This targets the obliques and hip flexors while adding coordination."
