  "description": "Set an incline bench at about 85-90 degrees under the Smith machine. Sit with bar starting at shoulder height. Grip slightly wider than shoulders, unhook and press overhead until arms are nearly straight. Lower with control to shoulder level. The guided path helps maintain proper form and allows you to press safely without a spotter."
