  "description": "Adjust the seat so the handles start at shoulder height. Sit with back firmly against the pad and press the handles overhead, extending arms without fully locking the elbows. Lower the weight with control back to shoulder level. Keep your core braced and avoid arching your lower back. The machine path ensures consistent shoulder engagement."
