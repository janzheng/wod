  "description": "An inverted hang position with arms behind the body, stretching the shoulders into deep extension. From a dead hang, perform a skin the cat movement to rotate backwards until your arms are behind you and your body hangs inverted. Hold this position with straight arms. You should feel an intense stretch in your chest, biceps, and front shoulders. This position builds the shoulder extension flexibility essential for back levers, planche, and advanced ring work. Start with bent knees to reduce intensity, and only go as deep as your shoulders comfortably allow. Progress slowly - forcing this position can cause injury. Hold for 15-30 seconds, building up over time."
