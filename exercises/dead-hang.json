  "description": "Simply hanging from a bar with arms fully extended - the foundation of all bar work. Grab a pull-up bar with an overhand grip and let your body hang with arms straight. Relax your shoulders initially (passive hang), then practice engaging them by pulling your shoulder blades down and back (active hang). Both variations have benefits: passive hangs decompress the spine and stretch the shoulders; active hangs build scapular control. Build up your hang time - this develops grip strength, shoulder health, and comfort on the bar. Aim for 30-60 second holds. This is prerequisite for all pull-up progressions."
