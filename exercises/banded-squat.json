  "description": "Stand on a resistance band with feet shoulder-width apart and loop the band behind your neck/over your shoulders (like a barbell back squat position). Perform squats as normal - the band adds resistance at the top of the movement, challenging your lockout. Keep chest up, core tight, and drive through your heels. Great for building explosive power out of the bottom position."
