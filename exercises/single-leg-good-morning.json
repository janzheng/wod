  "description": "Stand on one leg with a slight bend in the knee. Place your hands behind your head or crossed over your chest. Keeping your back straight and core engaged, hinge forward at the hips while simultaneously extending your non-standing leg straight behind you. Lower your torso until it is nearly parallel to the ground, maintaining a straight line from your head through your extended heel. Squeeze your hamstring and glute to return to standing. This exercise develops single-leg stability and posterior chain strength."
