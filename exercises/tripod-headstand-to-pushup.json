  "description": "Start in tripod headstand position with head and both hands forming a triangle base. Lower one leg toward the ground while maintaining balance, then raise it back up. After 10 leg movements, transition smoothly down through a pike position and immediately perform a push-up. Return to tripod headstand and repeat. This combines inversion strength, core control, and pushing power in one movement."
