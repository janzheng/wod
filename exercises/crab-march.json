  "description": "A challenging locomotion exercise in crab position. Sit on the floor and place your hands behind you, fingers pointing toward your feet. Lift your hips off the ground so your body forms a tabletop position - this is crab position. March forward by moving opposite hand and foot together (right hand + left foot, then left hand + right foot). Keep your hips lifted and core engaged throughout. You can also march backward or side to side. This builds shoulder stability, tricep strength, and full-body coordination while keeping heart rate elevated."
