  "description": "Position bar across upper back under the Smith machine. Place a box or bench in front of you at knee height. Unhook the bar, place one foot fully on the platform, then drive through that heel to step up. Bring the trailing foot up briefly, then step back down with control. The guided bar path allows you to load heavy while maintaining balance. Complete all reps on one leg, then switch."
