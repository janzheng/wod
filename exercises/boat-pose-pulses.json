  "description": "Hold boat pose with legs at 45 degrees and arms parallel to floor. While maintaining the V-shape, make small pulsing movements - slightly lowering and lifting your legs and torso. Keep the micro-movements controlled, never fully releasing the core tension. These pulses intensify the boat pose while building endurance in the elevated position."
