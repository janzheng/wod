  "description": "Face away from a wall or couch. Place one knee on the ground and your shin/foot up against the wall. Step the other foot forward into a lunge. Push your hips forward and keep your torso upright. This intensely stretches the hip flexors and quads of the back leg. Known as one of the most effective hip flexor stretches."
