  "description": "Hold the rope handles at hip height with elbows close to your sides. Swing the rope overhead and jump with both feet just high enough to clear the rope. Land softly on the balls of your feet. Keep a steady rhythm and minimize arm movement - the rotation should come from your wrists."
