  "description": "Position yourself in the Smith machine with the bar over your midfoot. Stand with feet hip-width apart, hinge at the hips to grip the bar just outside your legs. Keep your chest up and back flat. Drive through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously to stand tall. Reverse the movement with control, pushing your hips back while keeping the bar close to your body. The guided bar path allows you to focus on form."
