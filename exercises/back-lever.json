  "description": "A challenging gymnastics hold with your body horizontal and arms behind you. From German hang, lower your body with straight legs together until your back is parallel to the ground. Arms are straight behind you, body forms one rigid line. This places extreme demands on shoulder extension flexibility and strength, plus requires intense core tension. The biceps tendons are particularly stressed in this position. Prerequisites: comfortable German hang (30+ seconds), tuck back lever (15 seconds), straddle back lever (10+ seconds). Progress slowly - this movement can cause injury if rushed. Keep arms straight, body tight, and don't hold your breath. A 5-10 second hold with perfect form is impressive."
