  "description": "An inverted balance hold on your forearms - also known as Pincha Mayurasana in yoga. Start in dolphin pose (forearm plank with hips piked up). Place forearms parallel on the floor, shoulder-width apart, with palms flat or fingers interlaced. Walk your feet toward your elbows to stack hips over shoulders. Kick one leg up (or press both legs up for advanced practitioners) into the inverted position. Balance with legs together, pointed toward the ceiling, body in a straight line. Keep your core engaged, press firmly through your forearms, and look between your hands. Practice against a wall first before attempting freestanding. This builds shoulder strength and body awareness for handstand progression."
