  "description": "Set up in pike push-up position but with your feet elevated on a box, bench, or step. The higher your feet, the more vertical and challenging the movement becomes. Lower your head toward the floor between your hands, then press back up. This is a key progression toward handstand push-ups, shifting more weight onto your shoulders. Keep core tight throughout."
