  "description": "Hold a kettlebell locked out overhead in one hand. Squat down until thighs are at least parallel, keeping the arm fully extended and the bell directly over your shoulder. Drive through heels to stand. This demands excellent shoulder mobility, thoracic extension, and ankle flexibility. One of the best total-body stability exercises. Keep core braced and avoid arching the lower back."
