  "description": "This is the foundation of deep core activation. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on floor hip-width apart. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly just below your ribcage. INHALE slowly through your nose for 4 counts, feeling your belly rise into your hand while your chest stays relatively still - this is your diaphragm descending. EXHALE slowly through pursed lips for 6-8 counts, feeling your belly fall as your deep core muscles (transverse abdominis) engage to push air out. On the exhale, imagine you're gently drawing your belly button toward your spine and 'zipping up' from your pubic bone to your navel. This activates your deep stabilizing muscles including the pelvic floor. Each breath cycle is one rep. Stay relaxed in your shoulders and neck - all the action is in your core."
