  "description": "A dynamic front lever movement - essentially a pull-up performed in the front lever position. Start in your front lever hold (tuck, straddle, or full depending on ability). From this horizontal position, pull yourself up toward the bar while maintaining your body's horizontal orientation. Lower back to the front lever position with control. This is significantly harder than a standard pull-up because of the mechanical disadvantage and the need to maintain core tension throughout. Even performing tuck front lever pulls builds incredible strength. Focus on quality over quantity - a few good reps trump sloppy high reps."
