  "description": "Also known as Asian squat or deep squat hold. Squat down with feet flat (or heels on a yoga block if mobility is limited), knees wide, and hands in prayer position at your chest. Use your elbows to gently press your knees open. Keep your spine long and chest lifted. This pose opens the hips, stretches the groin, and improves ankle mobility. Can be held for extended periods - traditionally used as a resting position for work or eating."
