  "description": "Start in a high plank position with each hand on a dumbbell, feet wider than hip-width for stability. Keeping your hips level and core tight, row one dumbbell up to your ribcage, elbow close to your body. Lower with control and repeat on the other side. Minimize hip rotation throughout - this is as much a core exercise as it is a back exercise."
