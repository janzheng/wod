  "description": "Sit at the cable row machine with feet on the footrests and knees slightly bent. Grip the handle with arms fully extended, maintaining a tall spine. Pull the handle toward your lower chest/upper abdomen, driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together. Keep your torso stable - avoid swinging or using momentum. Control the weight back to the starting position with a slow eccentric. Focus on the mind-muscle connection with your mid-back."
