  "description": "Perform a headstand against a wall for support. With control, lower both legs down toward the ground (pike position) then raise them back to vertical. Keep your core extremely tight throughout. This is intense core work in an inverted position. The wall provides safety but try to minimize contact with it as you build strength."
