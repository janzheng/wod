  "description": "A squat variation that adds a calf raise at the top of the movement. Lower into a full squat with thighs parallel to the ground, keeping weight in your heels. Drive up to standing, and at the top of the movement, rise onto the balls of your feet into a calf raise, squeezing your calves at the peak. Lower heels back to the ground with control before beginning the next squat. This combination builds lower body strength while adding calf work and improving ankle stability."
