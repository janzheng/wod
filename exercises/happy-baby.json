  "description": "Lie on your back and bring your knees toward your armpits. Grab the outside edges of your feet with your hands (or use a strap). Gently pull your knees down toward the floor while keeping your tailbone grounded. Rock gently side to side if desired. This deeply stretches the hips and inner thighs."
