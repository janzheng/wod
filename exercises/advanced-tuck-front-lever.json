  "description": "The second front lever progression, harder than tuck but easier than straddle. Get into a tuck front lever position (back parallel to ground, arms straight). Instead of a tight tuck with knees at chest, extend your hips so your thighs are perpendicular to your torso - creating a 90-degree angle at your hips. Knees remain bent, but the increased hip extension makes this significantly harder than the basic tuck. Hold with straight arms, back flat and parallel to ground. Focus on lat engagement and core tension. This progression bridges the gap between tuck and straddle front lever. Hold for time, working up to 10-15 seconds before progressing."
