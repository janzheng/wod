  "description": "Stand holding a barbell at hip level with an overhand grip, feet hip-width apart. Push your hips back while keeping legs nearly straight (slight knee bend). Lower the bar along your legs until you feel a deep hamstring stretch - typically just below the knees. Keep your back flat and chest up throughout. Drive your hips forward to return to standing, squeezing glutes at the top. The bar stays close to your body the entire movement."
