  "description": "Stand on the center of a resistance band with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the ends with arms at your sides, palms facing back. Raise your arms straight out in front of you to shoulder height, keeping a slight bend in your elbows. Lower with control. The band provides progressive resistance throughout the movement. Great for high-rep shoulder conditioning and front deltoid development."
