  "description": "A unilateral pull-up variation that shifts most of the work to one arm. Use a wide grip on the bar. Pull yourself up while shifting your body toward one hand - the working arm bends fully while the other arm stays mostly straight, extending out to the side like drawing a bow. Your body moves diagonally toward the working arm. Lower with control and repeat on the same side, or alternate sides. This progression builds toward one-arm pull-ups by training each arm to handle more of the load. Keep the straight arm engaged (not completely passive) for safety."
