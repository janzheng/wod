  "description": "Lie on your back with arms along your sides, palms down. Using your core, lift your legs and hips off the floor, rolling up onto your shoulders until your legs point straight toward the ceiling. Your weight rests on your upper back and shoulders. Hold briefly at the top, then roll back down with control. This is a dynamic core exercise that also builds body awareness and control."
