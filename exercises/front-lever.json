  "description": "One of the most impressive calisthenics holds - your body held horizontally with arms straight. From a dead hang, engage your entire posterior chain and pull your body up and back until you're completely horizontal. Arms are straight, body forms one rigid line from hands to toes, legs straight and together. This requires extraordinary lat strength, core tension, and total body control. The pulling force comes primarily from your lats - think about pulling the bar toward your hips. Common mistakes: bent arms, piked hips, sagging body. Master all progressions first: tuck (10-15s), advanced tuck (10-15s), straddle (10-15s). Achieving even a 5-second hold with perfect form is a significant accomplishment."
