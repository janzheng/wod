  "description": "Perform push-ups while maintaining a hollow body position throughout. This means posteriorly tilting your pelvis (tucking tailbone), engaging your abs hard, and keeping your body in a slight banana curve rather than a straight line. Your lower back should never arch. This is significantly harder than regular push-ups and builds the core strength needed for advanced gymnastics skills."
