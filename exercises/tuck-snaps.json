  "description": "Lie on your back with arms overhead. Explosively snap your knees to your chest while simultaneously crunching your torso up, then quickly extend back out to full length. The movement should be rapid - snap in, snap out. Think of your body as a spring, quickly compressing and extending. This builds explosive core power used in dance and acrobatics."
