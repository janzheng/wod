  "description": "Lie on your side and prop yourself up on your forearm, elbow directly under shoulder. Stack your feet or stagger them for easier balance. Lift your hips off the ground to form a straight line from head to feet. Brace your core and squeeze your obliques hard. Hold this position with maximum muscle activation and tension. Breathe normally while maintaining the hold. Perform on both sides. Part of Dr. Stuart McGill's Big 3 core stability exercises - focus on quality of contraction over duration."
