  "description": "An advanced planche with straight legs spread wide. From floor or parallettes, lean forward with straight arms until you can lift your body horizontal to the ground. Legs are straight and spread wide in a straddle. The wider the straddle, the easier due to the shorter lever arm. Body should form a straight line from head through hips. Shoulders are protracted, arms locked straight. This requires exceptional pushing strength - particularly in the anterior deltoids - plus total body tension. The balance point is precise; too far forward and you fall, not far enough and you can't hold the position. Master advanced tuck planche (10-15 seconds) before attempting. Even a 3-5 second hold is impressive."
