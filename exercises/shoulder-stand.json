  "description": "Lie on your back with arms along your sides. Lift your legs up and over, then press your hips up toward the ceiling, supporting your lower back with your hands. Extend legs straight up so your body forms a vertical line from shoulders to toes. Weight should be on your shoulders and upper arms, not your neck. Hold the position while breathing steadily. A precursor to Plow Pose."
