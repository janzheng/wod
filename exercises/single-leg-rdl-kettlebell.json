  "description": "A single-leg Romanian deadlift holding a kettlebell for added resistance. Stand on your left leg holding a kettlebell in your right hand. Keep a soft bend in your standing knee. Hinge at the hips, extending your right leg straight behind you for counterbalance while lowering the kettlebell toward the floor. Keep your back flat and core engaged - your body should form a T-shape at the bottom. Lower until you feel a deep stretch in your standing leg hamstring. Squeeze your glute to return to standing. Complete all reps on one side before switching. The kettlebell adds load while challenging balance and single-leg stability."
