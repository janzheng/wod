  "description": "Start on all fours with hands under shoulders and knees under hips. Brace your core and maintain a neutral spine. Slowly extend one arm forward and the opposite leg backward simultaneously, focusing on stability and control. Keep your core tight and back flat - don't let your hips rotate or twist. Hold the extended position for 2-3 seconds with maximum muscle activation, then return to starting position with control. Switch sides. Focus on quality over speed - each rep should be deliberate and controlled with full body tension. Part of Dr. Stuart McGill's Big 3 core stability exercises."
