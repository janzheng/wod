  "description": "Stand on one leg in front of a box, bench, or chair. Extend the other leg straight in front. Lower into a single-leg squat until you tap the box with your glutes, then stand back up. The box provides a safety target and makes the movement easier than a full pistol squat. Great for building single-leg strength, especially on the left side."
