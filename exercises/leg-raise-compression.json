  "description": "Sit on the floor with legs extended straight in front of you. Place your hands beside your hips. Keeping legs straight, lift them as high as possible using your hip flexors, trying to bring your thighs toward your chest. Lower with control. This is pure hip flexor compression work - essential for L-sits, V-sits, and manna. Focus on the active lift from your hip flexors, not momentum."
