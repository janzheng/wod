  "description": "Lie on your back with legs spread wide in a straddle position, arms overhead. Engage your hip flexors and core to pull your legs up and together while crunching your upper body toward your legs, bringing everything into a compressed tuck at the top. Lower with control back to the straddle position. This builds the hip flexor strength and compression needed for L-sits and straddle holds."
