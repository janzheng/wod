  "description": "Start lying on the floor, kettlebell locked out overhead in one hand. Methodically rise to standing through a series of positions: roll to elbow, post to hand, bridge hips, sweep leg through to half-kneeling, then stand. Reverse the sequence to return to the floor. Keep eyes on the bell and arm locked out throughout. One of the best full-body stability exercises."
