  "description": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and extend your arms straight out to the sides at shoulder height, palms facing down. Make small circular motions with your arms, gradually increasing the size of the circles. After 10-15 seconds, reverse the direction. Keep your core engaged and shoulders down - avoid shrugging. This simple movement warms up the shoulder joint and activates the deltoids. Can be performed with light weights for added resistance."
