  "description": "The eccentric-only version of a one-arm pull-up - essential for building toward the full movement. Jump or use assistance to get to the top position (chin over bar) while holding with one arm. Slowly lower yourself down using only that arm, fighting gravity the entire way. Aim for a 5-10 second descent. The free arm can be held out to the side or placed on your chest. This builds the specific strength needed for one-arm pull-ups. Prerequisites: 15+ strict pull-ups, archer pull-ups, and good grip strength. Alternate arms each rep to prevent imbalances."
