  "description": "A wrist and hand mobility exercise for preparing the wrists for bar work. Stand or kneel with a bar (or use an imaginary bar position). Start with your hands in a standard grip position. Switch your hand position by rotating your wrists - alternate between overhand grip, underhand grip, and various angles. You can also perform wrist circles and rotations while maintaining the bar position. Focus on gradually increasing range of motion with each repetition. This exercise lubricates the wrist joints, improves flexibility, and prepares the wrists and forearms for gripping exercises like pull-ups, barbell squats, or bench presses. Perform slowly and stop if you feel any pain. Great for pre-workout wrist preparation."
