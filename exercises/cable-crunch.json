  "description": "Kneel facing a high cable with a rope attachment held behind your head. Crunch down by flexing your spine, bringing your elbows toward your knees. Focus on contracting your abs rather than pulling with your arms. Return to the starting position with control. Allows progressive overload on abs unlike bodyweight crunches."
