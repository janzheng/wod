  "description": "Combine a squat with an alternating front kick for cardio and leg strength. Lower into a squat position with thighs parallel to the ground. As you stand up explosively, kick one leg straight out in front of you at hip height. Return foot to ground and immediately squat again, kicking with the opposite leg on the next rep. Keep your core tight and chest up throughout. The kick challenges balance and engages hip flexors while the squat works the lower body."
