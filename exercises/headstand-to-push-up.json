  "description": "From headstand position, lower your legs down through a pike position and transition smoothly into a push-up at the bottom. Press back up and return to headstand. This flowing movement combines inversion work with pushing strength and requires excellent body control throughout the transition. Keep the movement smooth and controlled rather than using momentum."
