  "description": "An adjustable bodyweight row performed on gymnastic rings. Set rings at hip height. Grab the rings and walk your feet forward, leaning back until your arms are extended. The more horizontal your body, the harder the exercise. Pull yourself up by driving your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder blades together, and bringing the rings to your chest. Lower with control. Keep your body rigid like a plank throughout. Rings allow natural rotation of the hands during the pull, which is easier on the joints than fixed bars. Adjust difficulty by changing body angle - more upright is easier, more horizontal is harder."
