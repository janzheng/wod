  "description": "Sit at the cable row machine with your feet secured on the platform. Adjust the seat height so the handle is at chest level when your arms are extended. Grip the handle with both hands, palms facing each other. Pull the handle toward your torso, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement. Keep your core engaged and avoid arching your back. Slowly return to the starting position with control."
