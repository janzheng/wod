  "description": "Lie on your back with arms overhead. Quickly snap your legs apart into a wide straddle while lifting your torso, then snap them back together while lowering down. Move rapidly between the open straddle position and the closed flat position. This combines the straddle pattern with explosive speed, challenging both flexibility and power."
