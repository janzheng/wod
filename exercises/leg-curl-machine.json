  "description": "Lie face down on the machine with pad just above your ankles. Grip the handles and curl your heels toward your glutes, squeezing your hamstrings at the top. Lower with control - don't let the weight slam. Keep your hips pressed into the pad throughout. This isolates the hamstrings without loading the spine."
