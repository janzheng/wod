  "description": "The classic bodybuilding exercise for targeting the transverse abdominis - your deepest core muscle that acts like a natural weight belt. Can be performed lying down, on all fours, seated, or standing. For the LYING version: Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat. EXHALE ALL your air completely - push every last bit out. At the bottom of your exhale, draw your belly button IN and UP toward your spine as hard as you can, as if trying to touch your belly button to your backbone. You should feel your waist narrowing and your abdomen becoming hollow/concave. HOLD this position for the prescribed time (30 seconds) while taking small, shallow breaths through your chest only - do NOT let your belly expand. It will burn. Release and breathe normally between sets. For QUADRUPED version: Start on hands and knees, let your belly hang, exhale completely, then suck everything in and hold. This is harder because gravity is working against you. Key: This is NOT sucking in your gut superficially - it's a deep internal drawing-in sensation."
