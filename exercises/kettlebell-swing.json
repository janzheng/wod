  "description": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on the floor slightly in front. Hinge at hips to grab the handle with both hands. Hike the bell back between legs then explosively drive hips forward to swing the kettlebell to chest height. Arms stay straight - power comes from the hip snap. Let it swing back between legs and repeat. Russian-style swing ends at chest height."
