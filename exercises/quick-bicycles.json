  "description": "Perform bicycle crunches at maximum speed. Hands behind head, rapidly alternate bringing elbow to opposite knee in a pedaling motion. Keep the pace quick and consistent - this is about speed, not range. Maintain core engagement throughout and avoid pulling on your neck. Count each elbow-to-knee touch as one rep."
