  "description": "An advanced pull-up variation where you move horizontally at the top of the movement. Use a wide grip on the bar. Pull up until your chin is over the bar. While holding at the top, shift your body horizontally from one hand to the other - as you move toward one hand, that arm bends more while the other straightens. Move back and forth like a typewriter carriage. This is extremely demanding, requiring you to support most of your weight on one arm at each end. It's an excellent progression toward one-arm pull-ups. Lower and repeat, or continue typing for multiple passes."
