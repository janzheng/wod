  "description": "Sit on the floor (or chair) with feet flat on the floor and muscles relaxed. The heel rises naturally while the front of the foot stays put - this is a passive movement, not an active lift. When the heel reaches the top of its range of motion, passively release it to come back down. The aim is to simultaneously shorten the calf muscle while the soleus is naturally activated by its motor neurons. Keep the gastrocnemius relaxed - you can place your hand on the back of your calf near the knee to ensure it doesn't flex. This targets the soleus muscle specifically, which is important for metabolic health and ankle stability."
