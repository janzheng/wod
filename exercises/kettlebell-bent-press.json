  "description": "A classic old-time strongman lift. Start with the kettlebell in rack position. Instead of pressing the bell up, bend your torso AWAY from the bell while keeping the arm locked and the bell stationary. Your body moves under the weight rather than pressing it overhead. Requires significant shoulder mobility, core stability, and hip flexibility. One of the most efficient ways to get heavy weight overhead with one arm."
