  "description": "Position yourself in the leg press machine with just the balls of your feet on the lower edge of the platform. Start in a dorsiflexed position with toes pulled toward your shins, then press through the balls of your feet to a neutral ankle position using partial reps. Focus on the stretch-to-midrange portion of the movement for optimal calf development. Keep knees slightly bent throughout."
