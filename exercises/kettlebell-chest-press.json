  "description": "Lie on the floor (or a bench if available) with knees bent. Hold a kettlebell in one or both hands at chest level. Press the bell straight up to full arm extension, then lower under control until your upper arm touches the floor. Similar to a floor press but the kettlebell's offset center of mass adds a stabilization challenge. Keep elbows at roughly 45 degrees to protect the shoulders."
