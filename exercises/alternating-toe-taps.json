  "description": "A controlled dead bug progression exercise. Lie on your back with knees bent at 90 degrees, feet lifted so your shins are parallel to the ceiling (tabletop position). Your lower back should maintain its natural curve - not pressed flat, not excessively arched. Place hands on your hip bones to monitor for any pelvic movement. Engage your deep core by gently drawing your belly button toward your spine. MAINTAINING this core engagement and keeping your pelvis completely still, slowly lower ONE foot toward the floor until your toe lightly taps the ground, then return to the starting position. Repeat with the other leg. The KEY is keeping your lower back and pelvis absolutely stable - there should be NO rocking, NO arching, NO flattening as your legs move. If you feel your back changing position, you're lowering too fast or too far. Move with CONTROL - take 2-3 seconds to lower, tap, and return. Each toe tap = 1 rep. Alternate legs throughout."
