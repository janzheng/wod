  "description": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand at your side like a suitcase. Keep your shoulders level and core engaged - resist the urge to lean toward the weighted side. Squat down by pushing your hips back and bending your knees, keeping your chest up and the weight at your side. Descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Drive through your heels to stand. The asymmetric load challenges your core and obliques to maintain balance."
