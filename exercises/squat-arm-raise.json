  "description": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms at your sides (can hold light dumbbells for added resistance). As you descend into a squat, simultaneously raise your arms straight out in front of you to shoulder height. At the bottom of the squat, your thighs should be parallel to the ground and arms extended forward. As you stand up, lower your arms back to your sides. This combination movement elevates heart rate and works both lower and upper body."
