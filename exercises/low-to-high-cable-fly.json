  "description": "Sit on a bench between two low cable pulleys with cuff attachments around your wrists. Start with arms down and slightly behind you. Sweep your arms upward and inward in a wide arc, bringing them together in front of your upper chest. Squeeze the upper chest at the top, then lower with control back to the stretch position. The low-to-high angle targets the clavicular (upper) chest fibers."
