  "description": "Start in a hollow body position - lying on back with arms overhead, shoulders and legs lifted, lower back pressed into floor. Maintain this banana shape and rock forward and backward using your core, not momentum. Keep the hollow position locked in throughout the rocking motion. This builds the dynamic core control essential for dance and gymnastics."
