  "description": "The ultimate horizontal pushing hold - body parallel to the ground supported only by straight arms with legs together. This is one of the hardest calisthenics skills to achieve. From floor or parallettes, lean forward with locked arms until your body lifts into a perfectly horizontal position. Legs are straight and together. Shoulders protracted, entire body rigid. The strength demands on your anterior deltoids, chest, and core are extreme. Most athletes require years of dedicated training to achieve this. Prerequisites: straddle planche (10+ seconds), exceptional pushing strength, conditioned wrists, and patience. Don't rush this progression - proper development prevents shoulder injuries. Even a 2-3 second hold is world-class."
