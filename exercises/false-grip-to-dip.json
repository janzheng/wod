  "description": "A muscle-up transition drill practicing the movement from false grip pull to support/dip position. Start hanging from rings with a false grip (wrists wrapped over the rings, not palms). Pull yourself up as if doing a pull-up. As your chest reaches ring height, lean forward aggressively, rolling your hands over the rings and transitioning into the bottom of a dip position. Press up to support hold. Lower back down with control. This is the transition portion of a muscle-up, isolated for practice. Focus on the aggressive forward lean and fast hand rotation. The false grip must be maintained throughout the pull to make the transition possible. Prerequisite for ring muscle-ups."
