  "description": "Clean the kettlebell with both hands from the ground to the rack position at your chest, then immediately squat down until thighs are parallel. Drive through heels to stand. The two-hand clean makes this more beginner-friendly than a single-arm version. Explosive on the clean, controlled on the squat."
