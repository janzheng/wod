  "description": "Stand with feet hip-width apart and hands on your hips or at your chest. Step your right foot diagonally behind your left leg, crossing it behind as you lower into a lunge position - like a curtsy. Keep your front knee tracking over your toes and your torso upright. Lower until your front thigh is nearly parallel to the ground. Push through your front heel to return to standing. This variation targets the outer glutes (gluteus medius) more than standard lunges."
