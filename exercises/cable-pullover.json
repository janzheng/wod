  "description": "Stand facing away from a high cable with a straight bar or rope attachment. With a slight bend in your elbows, pull the cable in an arc from overhead down to your hips. Keep your core braced and focus on squeezing your lats throughout the movement. The cable provides constant tension unlike the dumbbell variant."
