  "description": "A beginner-friendly hanging core exercise. Hang from a pull-up bar with arms extended. Engage your core and raise your knees toward your chest by curling your pelvis up. Lower with control without swinging. Keep the movement controlled - avoid using momentum. Exhale as you lift your knees. This builds the core strength and hip flexor endurance needed for hanging leg raises and more advanced hanging movements. It also develops grip strength and comfort hanging from a bar. Progression: start with small knee raises, work toward bringing knees to chest, then progress to straight-leg hanging leg raises."
