  "description": "Set cable pulleys to shoulder height. Stand in the center with a handle in each hand, arms extended out to the sides with a slight elbow bend. Step forward into a staggered stance for stability. Bring your hands together in front of your chest in a hugging motion, squeezing your pecs hard at the center. Control the weight back, feeling the stretch in your chest. Keep the same elbow angle throughout - this is a fly, not a press."
