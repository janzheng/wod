  "description": "A controlled oblique activation exercise that emphasizes lateral core stability. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor about hip-width apart. Arms straight by your sides, palms down. Lift your head and shoulders slightly off the mat into a mini-crunch position - just enough to engage your abs but not straining your neck. MAINTAINING this position with your core engaged, reach your right hand toward your right heel by side-bending through your waist - sliding your hand along the floor. You should feel your right oblique contract. Return to center, then reach your left hand toward your left heel. Move SLOWLY and with control - this is not about speed. Keep your lower back pressed into the mat throughout. The movement is a controlled side-bend, not a full twist. Think of shortening one side of your waist while lengthening the other. Each reach (left or right) = 1 rep. Alternate sides smoothly. If your neck gets tired, rest briefly and resume."
