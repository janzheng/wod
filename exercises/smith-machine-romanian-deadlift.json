  "description": "Stand facing the bar with feet hip-width apart. Grip bar just outside your thighs. Unhook and stand tall. Push hips back while keeping legs nearly straight (soft knee bend). Lower bar along thighs until you feel a deep hamstring stretch. Drive hips forward to return. The guided bar path helps maintain proper form."
