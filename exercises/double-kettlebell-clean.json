  "description": "Start with two kettlebells on the floor between your feet. Hinge and grip both handles, then in one explosive motion pull the bells up close to your body and rotate your hands underneath to catch them in the rack position at your chest. Elbows stay tucked, bells rest on the forearms. Reverse the motion to return to the start. Requires solid single-bell clean technique before attempting doubles."
