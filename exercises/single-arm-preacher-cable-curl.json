  "description": "Set a low cable near a preacher bench. Rest one arm over the preacher pad and grasp the cable handle with an underhand grip. Curl the weight up by flexing at the elbow, squeezing the bicep at the top. Lower with control to a full stretch at the bottom. The preacher pad prevents swinging and the cable provides constant tension throughout the range of motion."
