  "description": "From lying on your back, lift both legs and torso to meet in a pike position and hold at the top. Your body forms a V-shape with legs straight and together, reaching hands toward feet. Maintain the elevated position with core engaged, keeping shoulders and legs off the ground. This static hold builds the compression strength dancers and gymnasts need."
