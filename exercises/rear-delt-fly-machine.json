  "description": "Sit facing the pad on a reverse pec deck machine and grip the handles with arms extended at chest height. Open your arms out to the sides in a wide arc, squeezing the rear delts and upper back at full contraction. Return slowly with control. Keep a slight bend in the elbows and avoid using momentum. Focus on initiating the movement from the rear delts rather than the traps."
