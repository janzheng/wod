  "description": "A dynamic mobility exercise that prepares the body for squatting. Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart. Lower into a deep squat position, going as low as your mobility allows while keeping feet flat on the ground. In the bottom position, you can place your hands on the floor for support if needed. From the deep squat, stand back up to the starting position. Repeat this movement smoothly, focusing on maintaining good form throughout. This exercise improves ankle dorsiflexion, hip mobility, and lower back flexibility while warming up the muscles used in squatting. Great as part of a squat warmup routine."
