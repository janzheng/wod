  "description": "Hold a kettlebell in one hand at your side like a suitcase. Hinge at the hips to lower the weight toward the ground while keeping your back straight and resisting the urge to lean to the loaded side. Drive through heels to stand tall. The offset load forces your core and obliques to work overtime to keep you upright. Great anti-lateral-flexion exercise.",
