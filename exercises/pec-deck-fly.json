  "description": "Sit with back flat against pad, elbows at 90 degrees on the arm pads. Squeeze your chest to bring the pads together in front of you. Focus on the contraction at the center, not just moving the weight. Control the movement back, feeling the stretch in your chest. Keep shoulders down and avoid shrugging. Excellent for chest isolation and mind-muscle connection."
