  "description": "Hold the kettlebell in the rack position at your shoulder. Dip slightly at the knees (quarter squat), then explosively drive through the legs to help press the bell overhead to full lockout. The leg dip lets you move heavier weight than a strict press. Lower the bell back to rack under control. Power comes from the legs, not just the arms.",
