  "description": "Place a kettlebell on the floor between your feet set wider than shoulder-width. Keeping chest upright and core braced, squat down by pushing hips back and bending knees. Reach down to touch or grab the kettlebell at the bottom while maintaining an upright torso. Drive through heels to stand. Similar to a sumo deadlift stance but with a full squat depth. The wide stance and upright torso emphasize the quads and inner thighs."
