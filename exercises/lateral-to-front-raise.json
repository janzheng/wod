  "description": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides with palms facing in. Raise the weights out to your sides (lateral raise) until they reach shoulder height. Hold briefly, then rotate your arms forward so the weights are now in front of you at shoulder height. Lower the weights back down to your sides with control. This compound shoulder isolation movement targets both the lateral and anterior deltoids in one fluid sequence. Can also be performed in reverse (front to side to down)."
