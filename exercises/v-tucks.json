  "description": "A controlled core exercise that's a gentler version of the full V-up. Sit on the floor with your knees bent, feet flat, hands placed slightly behind your hips for support (fingers pointing forward or out to sides). Lean back slightly to about 45 degrees - you should feel your abs engage to hold this position. Lift your feet off the floor with knees still bent, shins roughly parallel to the ground - this is your starting position. Now perform the tuck: EXHALE and bring your knees toward your chest while simultaneously leaning your torso slightly forward to meet them, creating a 'V' shape with your body. INHALE and extend back to the starting position with legs out (knees can stay slightly bent) and torso leaning back. Move with CONTROL - do not use momentum or swing. The key is maintaining constant core tension throughout the movement. Keep your spine in a neutral position (not rounded) and your chest lifted. Each tuck-and-extend = 1 rep. To make it easier, keep feet lightly touching the floor between reps. To make it harder, keep legs fully extended."
