  "description": "A push-up performed with hands placed near your hips instead of at shoulder level. Start in a planche lean position (hands by your waist, fingers pointing sideways or back, leaning forward over your hands). Perform a push-up in this position, lowering your chest toward the ground while maintaining the forward lean. Press back up. The further your hands are toward your hips and the more you lean forward, the harder it becomes. This builds the specific pushing strength needed for planche training. Keep core tight and body in a straight line. This bridges the gap between regular push-ups and tuck planche."
