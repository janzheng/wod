  "description": "Cross your arms in front of your body as the rope passes overhead, then uncross for the next rotation. Cross at hip level, not chest level. The key is timing - cross as the rope is coming down, jump through the loop, uncross as it comes back up. Practice the arm motion without jumping first."
