  "description": "Sit in the pin loaded incline press machine with back against the angled pad and handles at upper chest height. Press the handles forward and upward, extending your arms without locking elbows. The incline angle targets the upper chest and front delts. The pin loaded weight stack allows quick resistance changes, making it convenient for intensity techniques like drop sets."
