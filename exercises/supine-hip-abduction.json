  "description": "A core stability exercise that challenges your ability to maintain a stable pelvis while moving your legs sideways. Lie on your back with knees bent at 90 degrees, feet lifted so your shins are parallel to the ceiling (tabletop position). Keep your arms by your sides for stability. First, engage your deep core - exhale and gently draw your belly button toward your spine. MAINTAINING core engagement, slowly let one knee drop out to the side (abduction) while keeping the other knee pointing straight up. Only go as far as you can while keeping your pelvis level and lower back neutral - you should feel NO rotation in your spine. Return the leg to center and repeat on the other side. Move SLOWLY and with control. The challenge is keeping your pelvis rock-solid while your legs move. If you feel your back arching or your pelvis tilting, reduce your range of motion. Each leg drop = 1 rep. Alternate sides."
