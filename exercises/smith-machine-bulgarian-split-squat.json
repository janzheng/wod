  "description": "Position bar across upper back under the Smith machine. Place rear foot on a bench behind you. Take a forward step so your front knee stays over your ankle at the bottom. Unhook the bar and lower until your rear knee nearly touches the floor. Drive through the front heel to return. The guided bar path provides stability while still challenging single-leg strength. Complete all reps on one side, then switch legs."
