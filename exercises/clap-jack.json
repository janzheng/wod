  "description": "A jumping jack variation with an overhead clap. Start with feet together and arms at sides. Jump feet apart while swinging arms overhead and clapping at the top. Jump back to starting position with arms returning to sides. The clap adds coordination and engages the shoulders more than standard jumping jacks. Keep a steady rhythm and land softly on the balls of your feet."
