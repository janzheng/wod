  "description": "The second back lever progression with hips extended. Get into a tuck back lever position (inverted, back parallel to ground, arms straight behind you). Instead of a tight tuck, extend your hips so your thighs point outward from your body at roughly 90 degrees. Knees remain bent. This increased lever arm makes it significantly harder than basic tuck. Keep your back flat, arms straight, and shoulders actively supporting the position. This requires good shoulder extension flexibility and considerable strength. Hold for time, building up to 10-15 seconds before attempting straddle progression."
