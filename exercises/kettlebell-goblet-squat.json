  "description": "A squat variation holding a kettlebell at chest height like a goblet. Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, toes pointed slightly outward. Hold the kettlebell by the horns (handles) at chest height, close to your body. Keeping your chest up and core tight, lower into a deep squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees. Let your elbows track inside your knees at the bottom. Drive through your heels to stand back up. The front-loaded weight helps counterbalance and allows for a more upright torso, making this an excellent squat for building depth and proper form.",
