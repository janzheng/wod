  "description": "An unconventional kettlebell squat variation where the torso stays bent forward (nearly parallel to ground) throughout the movement. Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, kettlebell on the floor between feet. Hinge at hips with a deep forward lean, squat down to grab the kettlebell, then drive up through the legs while maintaining the hunched-over position. This hybrid squat/good-morning pattern loads the posterior chain significantly more than a standard squat. Seen on social media (@powerbrutehq) - exercise name is informal as this is not a standard movement."
