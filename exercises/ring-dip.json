  "description": "A dip performed on gymnastics rings - significantly harder than parallel bar dips due to stability demands. Start in a support hold at the top of the rings with arms straight, rings turned out slightly, and body upright. Keep the rings close to your body. Lower yourself by bending your elbows until your shoulders are below your elbows (or as deep as mobility allows). Press back up to full arm extension. The rings want to move apart, so you must actively squeeze them in while pushing. Keep your core tight and avoid excessive swinging. Master support holds and parallel bar dips before attempting ring dips. These build incredible pushing strength and shoulder stability."
