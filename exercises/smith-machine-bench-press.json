  "description": "Position a flat bench under the Smith machine bar. Lie with eyes under the bar, feet flat on floor. Grip bar slightly wider than shoulder-width. Unhook and lower to mid-chest, then press back up to near lockout. The guided path allows you to bench safely without a spotter. Great for building pressing strength."
