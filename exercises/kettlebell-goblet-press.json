  "description": "Hold the kettlebell at chest level by the horns in a goblet grip. Press it overhead with both hands until arms are fully extended, then lower back to chest. The two-handed grip makes this more stable and beginner-friendly than a single-arm press. Keep your core tight and avoid arching your back at the top.",
