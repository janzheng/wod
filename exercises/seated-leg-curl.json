  "description": "Sit in the machine with back against the pad and the ankle roller positioned just above your heels. Secure the thigh pad snugly above your knees. Curl your heels downward and underneath the seat, squeezing the hamstrings at full contraction. Return slowly to the start position. The seated position places the hamstrings in a stretched position at the hip, making this variation effective for muscle growth."
