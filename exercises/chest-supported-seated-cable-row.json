  "description": "Sit at a cable row station with your chest braced against the support pad. Grip the handles and row toward your torso with elbows tucked close to your sides, targeting the mid-back and lats. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at peak contraction, then extend arms fully for a deep stretch. The chest support eliminates momentum and keeps focus on the back muscles."
