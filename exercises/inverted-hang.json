  "description": "Hanging upside down from a bar or rings with your body vertical. From a dead hang, pull your legs up and over, rotating until your body is inverted - head down, feet pointing up. Arms are straight and body is vertical. On a bar, you can hook your legs over for security while learning. On rings, you need to maintain the position through core tension. This builds comfort being inverted, core strength, and grip endurance. It's also the starting position for skin the cat, ice cream makers, and lever progressions. Start with short holds and progress gradually. Blood rushing to your head is normal - come down if you feel dizzy."
