  "description": "The first progression toward a full back lever. Start by performing a skin the cat to get into German hang position. From German hang, pull your tucked knees up toward your chest and lift your hips until your back is parallel to the ground. Arms are straight and behind you, body inverted with knees tucked tight. Hold this position. This requires shoulder extension flexibility and strength in a vulnerable position. Make sure you're comfortable with German hang before attempting. Focus on keeping arms straight and maintaining body tension. Start with short holds (5-10 seconds) and progress gradually. Don't force depth if shoulders feel strained."
