  "description": "A squat variation on the smith machine where the torso stays bent forward throughout the movement, similar to a squat/good-morning hybrid. Position under the smith bar with a wider-than-shoulder stance. Keep torso hinged forward (nearly parallel to ground) while squatting down and up. The guided bar path provides stability for this unusual position. Heavily loads the posterior chain and quads simultaneously. Inspired by @powerbrutehq - non-standard form, use caution and start light."
