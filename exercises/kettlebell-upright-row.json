  "description": "Hold the kettlebell by the horns or handle with both hands in front of your body. Pull it straight up close to your torso by driving the elbows up and out, shrugging your shoulders at the top. No hip snap — this is a strict, controlled pull. Lower with control. Targets the shoulders and traps.",
