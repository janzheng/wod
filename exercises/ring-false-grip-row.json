  "description": "An inverted row performed on rings using a false grip - essential training for muscle-ups. Set rings at hip height and hang underneath with feet on the floor. Use a false grip: instead of gripping the rings in your palm, wrap your wrist over the ring so the bottom of your palm sits on top of the ring. This positions your wrist deep in the ring. Pull your chest to the rings while maintaining the false grip, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Lower with control. The false grip is uncomfortable at first but is prerequisite for ring muscle-ups. Start with feet elevated less to make it easier, progress to feet elevated on a box for full difficulty."
