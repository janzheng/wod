  "description": "Clean one or two kettlebells to the rack position at shoulders. Feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out. Squat down keeping elbows high and chest proud. The front-loaded weight demands more core and upper-back engagement than a back squat. Drive through heels to stand. Double kettlebell version is significantly harder.",
