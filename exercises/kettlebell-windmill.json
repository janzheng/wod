  "description": "Press the kettlebell overhead with one arm and lock it out. Turn your feet about 45 degrees away from the loaded side. Keeping your eyes on the bell, slowly hinge at the hip and lower your free hand toward your front foot. The overhead arm stays locked out the entire time. Reverse to standing. Demands serious hip mobility, oblique strength, and shoulder stability.",
