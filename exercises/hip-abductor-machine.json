  "description": "Sit in the machine with outer thighs against the pads and feet on the foot rests. Push your legs outward against the resistance, focusing on squeezing your outer glutes. Control the movement back to the starting position - don't let the weight snap back. Great for targeting the gluteus medius and improving hip stability."
