  "description": "A dynamic full-body movement that stretches and strengthens. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart. Hinge at the hips and place your hands on the floor in front of your feet, keeping legs as straight as possible to stretch the hamstrings. Walk your hands forward one at a time until you reach a high plank position. Pause briefly in plank, then walk your feet forward in small steps toward your hands, keeping legs straight. Return to standing and repeat. This warms up the entire posterior chain, core, and shoulders while building shoulder stability."
