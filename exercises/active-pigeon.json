  "description": "From pigeon pose position, engage your glutes and core to actively press your front shin into the ground while lifting your torso tall. Pulse or rock gently to create movement rather than holding statically. You can add torso rotations, reaching arms overhead, or shifting weight forward and back. This active version builds strength while opening the hips."
