  "description": "From headstand position, bring your knees into your chest in a tucked position and hold. This challenges core stability and balance in the inverted position. Keep your elbows bent at 90 degrees with hands on the floor forming a tripod base. The tuck position is a progression toward freestanding headstand control and press to handstand."
