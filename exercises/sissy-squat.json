  "description": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Lean your torso back while bending at the knees, keeping hips extended forward. Lower as far as possible until quads are fully stretched and engaged, then push back up through the quads. Use a wall or support for balance if needed. Zero spinal load — all quad isolation. Great for building quad size without lower back strain.",
