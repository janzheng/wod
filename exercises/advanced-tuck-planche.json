  "description": "The progression between tuck planche and straddle planche. Get into a tuck planche position (feet off ground, arms straight, knees tucked). Instead of keeping knees at chest, extend your hips back so your thighs point behind you while keeping knees bent. Your back should flatten out, creating a more horizontal body position. This significantly increases the lever arm and difficulty. Maintain the forward lean, straight arms, and protracted shoulders. The flatter your back, the harder it becomes. Work toward 10-15 second holds before progressing to straddle planche. This builds the specific strength needed for the straighter body positions."
