  "description": "Hold one or two kettlebells in the rack position at shoulders. Squat down to at least parallel, then explosively drive up and use the momentum to press the kettlebells overhead. Lock out at the top, then lower bells back to rack as you descend into the next squat in one fluid motion. Great metabolic conditioning exercise."
