  "description": "Sit at the lat pulldown machine with your thighs secured under the pads. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width with palms facing away. Lean back slightly and pull the bar down toward your upper chest, leading with your elbows. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the bottom of the movement. Control the weight back up, fully extending your arms without shrugging your shoulders. Focus on feeling your lats engage throughout the movement."
